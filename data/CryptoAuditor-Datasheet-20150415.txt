CryptoAuditor   CryptoAuditor is a centrally managed inline or virtual appliance for auditing and reviewing encrypted data and monitoring privileged users    activities in encrypted environments  It lowers security risks  increases resiliency and enables compliance   The Problem  Privileged users need access to critical systems  devices and data to do their jobs  Their activities are secured by protocols such as SSH  RDP and SSL  Shared accounts and encrypted communications make it difficult to know which privileged user is doing what  where and when  However  there has to be accountability and control  Every session and command must be traced to an individual and individuals should not have more access than they need to do their jobs  Finally  malicious activity must be stopped in real time  These are not just    nice to have    capabilities  Lack of accountability  control and real time response expose your organization to data breach  denial of service and compliance failures   The Solution  CryptoAuditor is a network based  inline traffic monitor that decrypts and records the activities of privileged users without interfering with their normal workflow  Because there are no agents to deploy  it works regardless of what devices users connect with and what they connect to   CryptoAuditor is more than a passive monitor  It provides identity based policy controls that limit where privileged users can go in your network and what they can do  CryptoAuditor also integrates with your DLP  IDS and SIEM systems  enabling real time detection and prevention of data loss  Here is how CryptoAuditor protects your critical assets      Accountability  You know exactly who the user is and what they did     Control  Privileged access on a    need to know  need to do    basis     Audit  An indexed database of privileged sessions including video replay of graphical sessions     Real time defense  Your SIEM  DLP and IDS gain real time visibility into encrypted sessions     Easy deployment  Transparency and distributed architecture enable efficient  low cost deployment   SSH Communications Security   www ssh comDon   t Let a Trusted Insider Become an ExploitCryptoAuditor

works as a trusted audit point  It decrypts  inspects  records and re encrypts privileged user sessions in real time  Virtual appliances are deployed at key locations in the network   in front of server farms  databases and network entry points  It can be deployed in a fully transparent mode so you don   t need to change end user access and login procedures  A centralized console provides unified management  Sessions are indexed and stored in an encrypted database for reporting  replay and forensic investigation    CryptoAuditor solves diverse security challenges in the cloud and

Data in Transit Solutions from the Company thatInvented the SSH ProtocolTectia SSH Server for IBM z OS is a turnkey  enterpriseclass Secure Shell  SSH  server that enables secure transfer of large amounts of mission critical business information without modi    cation or scripts  FTP     le transfer jobs  applications  or IT infrastructure Tectia SSH Server for IBM z OS includes SSH Communications Security client and server tools  delivering unmatched data integrity and strong authentication with both drag and drop and automated secure     le transfers Tectia SSH Server for IBM z OS supports direct MVS data set access  interactive MVS data set listing  interfacing with JES  I O streaming  con     gurable ASCII EBCDIC code set conversions  checkpoint restart  and FTP compatibility commands  such as the SITE command Secure File Transfers for MainframesTectia   SSH Server for IBM z OSData SheetSSH Communications Security   sales ssh com   www ssh comIn large and medium sized enterprises  mainframes are still relied upon as the most trusted  secure repository for Big Data   Because the mainframe technology itself is a vault for core systems and databases  encryption of the connections coming to and from it needs to be emphasized as much as data at rest   Unsecure FTP is still prevalent in many environments  which puts your backend data at risk   Today  compliance   internal and external  government regulations and PCI concerns mandate that data in transit is encrypted and protected at all ends of the enterprise and cloud   The mainframe is no longer alone   SSH Communications Security can provide solutions that prevent security breaches  brand damage and     nancial losses that can have detrimental eff ect on enterprises    reputation and trust

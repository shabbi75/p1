Two factor authentication provides an additional layer ofsecurity by using two different methods to verify theuser   s identity  What you know  user name andpassword  and what you have  e g  a token or softwareapplication   Hardware and software solutions can bescalable enough for corporate internal use  but when theorganization wants  or more often  is demanded toprovide strong authentication also for their partners suppliers  or end customers  the deployment andmanagement of any hardware devices or softwarepackages becomes a real problem Versatile Authentication PlatformWith multiple authentication methods available  TectiaMobileID serves as a versatile authentication platformproviding login also through the use of hardware tokens software tokens  e mail  or even password lists  The widerange of available methods allows smooth migration andstrong authentication beyond the mobile service coverage Two Factor Authentication Made ConvenientTectia   MobileIDData SheetSSH Communications Security   sales ssh com   www ssh comDo you want to identify your end users securely and conveniently Do you want to do it with a scalable and easily deployable solution Do you want to provide better service and increased security foryour employees  customers  and partners The Most Convenient Two Factor Authentication AvailableTectia MobileID provides a strong two factorauthentication service through mobile phones  Instead ofcarrying a separate hardware token or installing asoftware application  the user simply enters the one timepassword provided into his mobile phone as a textmessage  The one time password can be pre sent ordelivered at login time using a high priority SMS operatorchannel  Tectia MobileID does not require anyapplications installed on the user   s mobile phone makingthe user experience     awless  easy to understand and use Tectia MobileID Server uses the mobile phone numbers stored in internal or external directories of thecorporation  and provides multiple interfaces  so it can be integrated smoothly into the existing corporateapplications  and the company security processes andsystems can be kept intact With Tectia MobileID you can     Increase security for accessing critical systems with no effort from end users    Save on operational and maintenance costs with a tokenless solution    Activate new users  partners  and ad hoc accounts instantaneously instead of days or weeksTectia MobileID ServerAD LDAPVPN Endpoints  e g Cisco Juniper CheckpointApplication Servers  e g Tectia Citrix MSRemote UserCompanySMS Hub ServiceOperatorUserHello Jane  your one timepassword is 5749322 Speci    cationsSupported Third PartyProducts    F5 FirePass SSL VPN    F5 BIG IP Access Policy Manager    SAP Netweaver    Juniper VPN SSL VPN    Citrix Access Gateway    Citrix WEB Interface  5     Aventail VPN SSL VPN    CheckPoint VPN SSL VPN    Nortel VPN SSL VPN    MS OWA  2003 2007 2010     Tectia Client   Server    Custom IIS applications    Custom Apache applications    Other applications using Unix PAMServer Requirements    LDAP SQL user database    Connection to SMS Gateway orSMSC Short Message Service Center Performance Figures    1 GHz  1 GB RAM machine canhandle up to 200 simultaneous logins SSH Communications Security   sales ssh com   www ssh comAuthentication Options    Multiple types of One Time Passwords  OTP      On demand SMS Email OTP    Pre delivered SMS Email OTP    Pre delivered SMS Email PDF OTPlist  up to 200 passwords     Reusable SMS Ticket  time or usagerestricted password     Failover OTP    Conventional hardware token withsynchronized OTP generator    Software token with synchronized OTP generatorServer and UserAdministration    Web based GUI for user and serveradministration    Integrates with Windows Domainauthentication    Mobile numbers can be retrieved from a directory or from a database    Support for ad hoc accounts    Automatic failover and account locking mechanisms    Real time resource monitoring andtraps    SMS and Email alertsFeaturesCustomization    Modular architecture that providesextensive scalability and customization    Granular control on network conditions and business policies with Rules    OTP format  length  and life time arecon    gurable    All messages customizable and localizable per Domain  Group  or ServiceService Provider Capabilities    Multi domain support    Customer speci    c rules forauthentication and access    Customer speci    c rules for localization  reporting  billing  and accountingSupported Server Platforms    All virtual platforms that supportOpen Virtualization Format OVF   e g  VMware ESX  CitrixXenServer  and MS Hyper VUser Device Requirements    Any phone capable of receivingSMS messages  for SMS OTP     Email connectivity  for OTP list

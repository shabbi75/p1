Missing IdentitiesAn Identity Management Application NoteSSH Communications Security   sales ssh com   www ssh comWhat Active Directory Doesn   t SeeIdentity management in large heterogeneous IT environments is complex and in many enterprises  a work in progress  The fundamental challenge is how to bring disparate operating systems and authentication systems under central management including a unified directory where all identities reside  The benefits are significant  Centralized identity management offers better security  administrative efficiency and the end user convenience of single sign on  There are solutions that provide the glue that binds disparate systems together under a unified directory structure  However  few if any of them include access controls for identities that drive automated processes  As more and more data center and business processes are automated  the number of machine identities keeps rising even as the number of interactive user identities remains static or even declines  The result is centralized identity management governance is addressing an ever shrinking share of overall identities enterprise wide  This application note discusses the underlying difficulties in managing machine identities and describes a practical solution to this complex problem Machine Identities  Who Are These Guys Machine identities can enable process automation as illustrated in the following examples      System health and monitoring solutions automatically connect to multiple servers in order to collect log information     Automated file transfer of purchase and credit card information from point of sale devices to data center servers     Regular data base backups Secure Shell  SSH  using SSH public private key pairs to authenticate machine based identities is widely used for process automation  In many cases there is no central directory store of machine based identities or the related authentication credentials  SSH keys   The machine requesting access to another machine  e g  log manager requesting access to server logs  authenticates directly via an SSH private user key  rather than having the authentication request processed by a directory such as AD  This opens a number of security and access management headaches including difficulty in tracking the identities  controlling their use and preventing identity compromise  So why don   t enterprises simply move these identities and authentication processes to a centralized  AD Kerberos based system  Unfortunately there are some significant barriers to achieving this 1  Migrating all the Unix local user accounts into AD can be a massive effort  2  Due to localized nature of these accounts  accounts may share the same UIDs and other conflicting information which makes the migration into individual AD accounts more complex  3  Even if the account migration can be completed successfully  accounts often have many authorized public keys and there is often little or no information as to where the corresponding private keys reside  who owns them and what processes they support  In the absence of this information there is no way to remove and replace these authorizations in AD without causing major risk of disrupting vital business processes 3  AD Kerberos requires end user interaction when the first ticket is requested  There are workarounds to make this work on automated processes such as hard coding AD credentials in a startup script  Kerberos keytab or password files but these approaches raise other security concerns 4  Some automated processes may have hard coded authentication settings  for example enforcement of defined SSH key or built in credentials  and changing authentication to Kerberos may break those automated processes 5  Non Windows systems  Unix  Linux  IBM USS  MAC  do not have native support for AD authentication  so all servers need to be updated with add on PAM modules or commercial tools 6  By default  Kerberos provides Kerberos realm wide authentication to all the defined user accounts and further access controls are configured through AD group memberships or through commercial tools  Tightening up access controls on automated identities may be problematic as grouping of application identities and their connection points is not as  straightforward as human user identities  SSH Communications Security   sales ssh com   www ssh comCentralized identity management solutions such as Centrify and CA SiteMinder have robust PAM support for attaching non Windows systems to AD environments  Unfortunately they don   t address the challenge of migrating business processes  In short  there is no practical way to get from here to there  A Structured Approach to Machine Identity ManagementThe challenge of unmanaged machine identities has grown over time  Data center growth has been explosive  Large server infrastructures can be home to hundreds of thousands or even millions of secure shell user key based identities  Universal SSH Key Manager  UKM  from SSH Communications Security centralizes identity information and provides a structured and non disruptive approach for migration  The UKM approach accomplishes the following 1  Discovers all the identities across local and centralized repositories 2  Monitors all the identities and trust relations  what are the connection endpoints  who is accessing where using what user accounts   determining which are not used  which are used and what processes they support 3  Remediates     removes authorizations that are legacy or against defined access policies and makes necessary changes to authorizations in accordance with company specific policy 4  Locks down the infrastructure     makes sure no identity moves  adds or changes occur outside of central management  5  UKM can be deployed as a standalone solution or as part of a broader AD Kerberos based solution that includes privileged users such as systems administrators and application developers Only UKM provides non disruptive visibility and tools to identify and manage machine based identities which are the critical success factors for addressing this identity management challenge UKM is helping some of the world   s largest institutions solve the problem of managing machine based identities For more information please visit www ssh com ukm

Universal SSH Key Manager   Data SheetIdentity and Access Management for Secure Shell InfrastructureSSH Communications Security   sales ssh com   www ssh comAs the inventors of the Secure Shell protocol  SSH Communications Security is focused on helping IT organizations secure the path to their information assets  Our Universal SSH Key Manager is a multiplatform  scalable solution that brings compliance and control to Secure Shell environments  Universal SSH Key Manager reduces risk of unauthorized access from both internal and external actors  solves thorny compliance issues and reduces costs The Problem The vast majority of large enterprises rely on Secure Shell  SSH  to provide secure authentication and confidentiality  encryption  for many business critical functions such as automated backups  day to day file transfers and interactive user access for systems administration  Many mission critical IT functions are enabled through SSH  However  most enterprises use manual processes for generating  configuring and deploying the SSH public and private keys that enable these functions  Over time  this results in the uncontrolled proliferation of authentication keys  Security managers lose visibility and control over who has access to what servers and whether access rights previously granted should be revoked  It becomes nearly impossible to map the trust relationships between individual users  system accounts and application IDs with their respective destination servers  Standard identity and access management solutions that govern end user access typically do not encompass SSH key based access to systems and accounts  Lack of governance and control is exposing enterprises to elevated risk  compliance failures and the excess overhead of manual processes The Challenge Traditional approaches to managing SSH user keys are time consuming and expensive  and there is little if any automation or auditability  Because so many business critical functions   many of them automated   rely on SSH  it is very difficult to bring SSH Key management under control without disrupting those functions  The problem is highlighted when there is need to revoke access when there are organizational changes  employee departures  mergers and acquisitions  Enterprises generate significant overhead in the day to day activity of SSH user key setups  have increased risk from the lack of key renewals and removals  and face pressure from compliance initiatives  Lower Costs  Eliminate inefficient and error prone manual administration processes                                                            Reduce Risk  Protect against catastrophic loss   gain control and visibility over all privileged access

disruptive solution is needed to eliminate inefficient and error prone manual processes  dramatically reduce risk and address compliance exposures  Finally  processes and controls are needed to take care of the issues now and ensure they don   t re emerge in the future The Solution SSH Communications Security   s Universal SSH Key Manager  UKM  is an enterprise grade SSH user key management solution  UKM takes a non disruptive approach that enables enterprises to gain and retain control of the SSH infrastructure without interfering with production systems  No need to rip and replace how users get their work done or change the hundreds of automated processes that are the lifeblood of ongoing business  UKM   s non disruptive approach is based on three principles  Discover   Discover all SSH keys  map trust relationships and identify policy violations Remediate  Remove keys that should be revoked and bring valid keys under correct policy compliance  Manage  Eliminate manual processes  centralize control  enforce compliance  audit all activity UKM on average saves a typical Fortune 1000 organization  1 to  3 million per year in overhead costs while reducing the risk of serious security breach and resolving open compliance issues  Whether your environment uses OpenSSH   Tectia  or other common SSH implementations  UKM brings this complex problem under control
